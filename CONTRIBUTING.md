# Contribution Guidelines

## Code Review

1. Develop on branches. Naming convention for branches is all lowercase and dashes, prefixed with your github username. e.g. ```lorenyu-some-feature```. Also include the JIRA ticket number in relevant commit messages if working from a JIRA issue.

2. Use github pull requests for code reviews.
    1. Assign and add as reviewer one or two code reviewers.
        1. In selecting code reviewers, consider assigning code reviewers who are most intimately familiar with the changing parts of the code base (see git history), and / or a technical lead. If the change is high risk and / or includes lots of line changes, include a technical lead. If the change is low risk, consider distributing PR review load to other contributors.
    2. Add as reviewers or @cc additional engineers if you want them to be aware of the change.

## Merging to master

Before merging to master, PR should have been approved following code review.

1. Do a squash merge:

	```bash
	$ git checkout master
	$ git pull
	$ git merge your-branch-name --squash
	$ git commit
	# IMPORTANT: Commit Message Format - see example below
	# Add a summary line at the top -- if working from a JIRA issue, include that number at the beginning
	# For example: 'ABC-123: Updates README with instructions for db backup and restore'
	# Add 'Closes \#[github's pull request id].' (without the backslash)
	# Add a description of the change.
	# Add any Github reviewers.
	# Remove the rest of the autogenerated squash commit message.
	$ git push
	```

	Example commit message:

		ABC-123: Added benchmark data model to developer docs

		Closes #394

		Adding the benchmark data model to developer documentation. Shows
		the individual fields as well as explains the difference between
		historical and current benchmarks.
