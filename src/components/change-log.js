This is because the exclusion is attesting to the opposite condition as the original measure.  See details:

  <ul>
    <li>
      All Submission API endpoints will now support "entityType": "apm" and "entityId": APM entity Id.  This is in addition to the entityTypes already supported.
    </li>
    <li>
      LVT Opt-In elections for APMs is managed by AMS and as such the LVT Opt-In election cannot be made for the APM through QPP and only through AMS.  The Final Score process will take into account LVT Opt-In elections for the APM entity.  The Submissions API endpoints cannot enforce that an LVT Opt-In election has been made in AMS.  Thus there are no LVT Opt-In submission scenarios to test for apm entities.
    </li>
    <li>
      An APM entityType will be able to submit the following types of measurementSets:
      <ul>
        <li>
          "category": "quality" AND "submissionMethod": "registry" OR  "submissionMethod": "electronicHealthRecord" are allowed.
        </li>
        <li>
          "category": "ia" are allowed.  Note: for "category": "ia" scoring rules for APMs are such that IA submissions are not necessary, as APMs will receive a 100% auto-credit for that category.
        </li>
        <li>
          "category": "pi" is not allowed.  PI scores for the APM entity will be rolled up from the Group and Individual participants in the APM.  If you try to submit PI you will receive an error.
