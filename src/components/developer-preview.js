        <h1 className='ds-h1' id='overview'>Overview</h1>
        <p className='ds-text'>The Developer Preview allows developers to build direct integrations with other software to test programmatically submitting Quality Payment Program (QPP) performance data to CMS. The APIâ€™s functionality in the Developer Preview closely matches that of the QPP system that is in production.</p>
        <p className='ds-text'>The base URL for the Developer Preview is: <strong>https://preview.qpp.cms.gov/api/submissions/</strong></p>

        <h2 className='ds-h2'>What 3rd party developers can do with the Submissions API</h2>
        <p className='ds-text'>Using the data exposed through the API, developers can:
          <ul>
            <li>Submit, update or delete Promoting Interoperability and Quality measures, as well as Improvement Activities.</li>
            <li>Receive feedback on whether or not you correctly formatted your data.</li>
            <li>Receive a sample score for a submission. Since sample scores only reflect measure categories submitted to date, they do not represent a guarantee of the final score, and therefore, should not be used to make business decisions. Additionally, as a 3rd party developer, you can only view scores based on data you have submitted.</li>
            <li>Read, update, and delete data. Developers can read, update, and delete data that they submitted. Qualified Registries and Qualified Clinical Data Registries that are CMS-approved for the current performance year can create measurement sets and add them to any submission object.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 className='ds-h2'>Object Types</h2>
        <p className='ds-text'>The Submissions API has three types of objects:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Submissions</strong>: A submission object contains any performance data submitted on behalf of a single MIPS-eligible clinician, practice or group.</li>
            <li><strong>Measurement sets</strong>: A measurement set object represents a set of performance data related to one specific category (Promoting Interoperability, Improvement Activities, Quality), and is tied to a submission object.</li>
            <li><strong>Measurements</strong>: A measurement object represents one single data point related to a specific measure in a given category, and is tied to a measurement set object.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 className='ds-h2'>Authentication</h2>
        <p className='ds-text'>Both the Developer Preview and the Production environments require a JSON Web Token ("API key") for authentication purposes.</p>

        <a className='ds-c-button ds-c-button--primary' href='/qpp-submissions-docs/developer-preview#api-key'>Get an API Key</a>

        <h1 className='ds-h1' id='api-key'>Get an API Key</h1>
        <p className='ds-text'>The Developer Preview is open to 2018 CMS-approved Qualified Registries ("registries") and Qualified Clinical Data Registries ("QCDRs"). Each 2018 registry and QCDR will receive a unique API key via email during the week of September 24, 2018. The email will come from <a href='mailto:partnership@cms.hhs.gov'>partnership@cms.hhs.gov</a>, and will be sent to the designated Technical Contact for the organization.</p>
        <p className='ds-text'>The email will contain a secure URL, which can be used to access the API key. This API key will only work in the Developer Preview environment. It cannot be used for production submissions.</p>
        <p className='ds-text'>Note that the URL expires a week from when it is sent, so we recommend that the recipient open it right away, and save the API key in a secure location.</p>
        <p className='ds-text'>If you have any questions or issues getting your API key, please contact the Quality Payment Program Service Center at <a href='mailto:QPP@cms.hhs.gov'>QPP@cms.hhs.gov</a> or 1-866-288-8292 and ask to be put in touch with API Support.</p>

        <h1 className='ds-h1' id='authentication'>Authentication</h1>
        <p className='ds-text'>You must authenticate your account when using the Developer Preview (base url: <strong>https://preview.qpp.cms.gov/api/submissions/</strong>). Authenticate via bearer auth by adding your API token to the header of every request using the key value: <strong>Authorization: Bearer [YOUR API TOKEN]</strong>.</p>
        <p className='ds-text'>API keys carry many privileges, and must not be shared in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub and in client-side code.  Even within organizations, access must be limited to staff embedding it in software.</p>
        <p className='ds-text'>All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests in the Developer Preview without authentication will also fail.</p>

        <p className='ds-text'>If you are a Registry or QCDR using the Developer Preview, you have an API key that is associated with an 'organization'. This affects what endpoints you are authorized to use, and what behavior each endpoint has.</p>

        <p className='ds-text'>If you are a Registry or QCDR using the Developer Preview, you have an API key that is associated with an 'organization'. This affects what endpoints you are authorized to use, and what behavior each endpoint has.</p>
        <p className='ds-text'>At a high level, your API key allows you to create and edit data using the <code>/measurement-sets</code> and <code>/measurements</code> endpoints. You cannot create data using the <code>/submissions</code> endpoint.

        <h1 className='ds-h1' id='special-scoring'>How to Test Special Scoring Scenarios</h1>
        <p className='ds-text'>A submission to the Submissions API requires a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and may include a National Provider Identifier (NPI). These identifiers are used to accurately attribute the submission to a provider. A provider's profile includes information which is used to trigger special scoring scenarios.</p>
        <p className='ds-text'>Currently, no special scoring scenarios are applied in the production environment. Every submission is attributed with the default provider profile, which incurs no special scoring.</p>
        <p className='ds-text'>In order to support the testing of special scoring scenarios, the Submissions API features a provider profile stub in the Developer Preview environment for the <code>/score-preview</code> endpoint. The provider profile stub is not applied to the <code>/score</code> endpoint.</p>
        <p className='ds-text'>In the Developer Preview, there are 23 pre-defined TINs that represent various special scoring scenarios. By using these TINs to submit data, you will be able to see how certain characteristics of a provider's profile can impact a provider's composite score.</p>
