        <p className='ds-text'>The Developer Preview allows developers to build direct integrations with other software to test programmatically submitting Quality Payment Program (QPP) performance data to CMS. The APIâ€™s functionality in the Developer Preview closely matches that of the QPP system that is in production.</p>
        <p className='ds-text'>The Submissions API base URL for the Developer Preview is: <strong><a href='https://preview.qpp.cms.gov/api/submissions'>preview.qpp.cms.gov/api/submissions</a></strong></p>

        <h2 className='ds-h2'>What 3rd party developers can do with the Submissions API</h2>
        <p className='ds-text'>Using the data exposed through the API, developers can:
          <ul>
            <li>Submit, update or delete Promoting Interoperability and Quality measures, as well as Improvement Activities.</li>
            <li>Receive feedback on whether or not you correctly formatted your data.</li>
            <li>Receive a sample score for a submission. Since sample scores only reflect measure categories submitted to date, they do not represent a guarantee of the final score, and therefore, should not be used to make business decisions.</li>
            <li>Read, update, and delete data. Developers can read, update, and delete data that they submitted.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 className='ds-h2'>Authentication</h2>
        <p className='ds-text'>Both the Developer Preview and the Production environments require a JSON Web Token ("API key") for authentication purposes. If you are a CMS-approved Qualified Registry or QCDR, your token is available for download on <a href='https://qpp.cms.gov/'>qpp.cms.gov</a>.  Instructions on how to download a Dev-Pre and Production Registry token can be found <a href='https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/qpp-apis/IQvcL7M-ZqE/MrufMCFTAgAJ'>here</a>.</p>
        <p className='ds-text'>Anyone may continue to test the current iteration of the Developer Preview environment through our Interactive Documentation. A default API token is embedded on this website, which you may also use for testing. To retrieve this token, test any endpoint on the website and then copy it from the API's cURL response. Please keep in mind this token reflect Qualified Registry and QCDR access to the Developer Preview Submissions API endpoints.</p>
        <p className='ds-text'>OAuth is a new authentication method for the Submissions API beginning with the PY2019 submission window. To learn more about testing OAuth in the Developer Preview, please see <a href='/getting-started-with-oauth2'>Getting Started Using QPP OAuth2</a>.</p>

        <h2 className='ds-h2'>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Any data submitted in the Developer Preview will not count toward a MIPS-eligible clinician or group's final score in the Quality Payment Program.</li>
          <li>Since the Developer Preview is an integration environment for the Submissions API, it may be changed in ways that break backward compatibility and is not subject to any service-level guarantees or deprecation policy.</li>
        </ul>
